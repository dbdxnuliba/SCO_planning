%   SCRIPT TO COMPUTE THE TORQUES AT EACH JOINT FOR DIFFERENT MOTION STATES OF
%   a 2 DOF robotic arm.
%   
%   In order to select an actuator (i.e. an electric motor, brushless for
%   example), we may need.
%   Nominal torque and speed: torque and speed for the 80% of the use of the motor. 
%   Peak torque and speed: torque and speed for short periods of time. That
%   is: a higher torque that can be exerted at higher speeds during a
%   maximum of a 20% of the time.
%   
%   Of course, the 80-20% are just bare numbers and should be given by the
%   robot manufacturer. Actually the torque in any motor depends directly
%   on the quantity of current that can be driven into the motor.
%   Typically, the peak torque is associated with a peak current. If the
%   peak current is maintained for a long time the motor will not be able
%   to dissipate the heat inside, thus generating high temperatures that
%   could melt the coils, conductors... etc.
%
%   The script uses the inverse dynamic model of the robot to simulate
%   different motion states and compute the torques for each situation.
%   The torques at each joint, as well as the torques at each motor are computed
%   (reduced by the gear ratio). A trapezoidal speed profile can be
%   selected at the parameters section of this file. This trapezoidal
%   profile should meet the desired features of the robot, such as maximum
%   joint speed, maximum acceleration/deceleration.
%   Please note that the movement of the robot is not simulated. The reader
%   should imagine that the manipulator is fixed at a given initial
%   position and the inverse dynamic function returns the torques at each
%   joint necessary to bring the arm to that motion state (defined by position q,
%   speed qd and acceleration qdd).
%   
%   As a reference, below you can find the call to the inverse dynamics
%   function.

% PARAMETERS SECTION
%   Feel free to change the values of q, maximum_speeds and 
%   maximum_accels. 
%  
%   This script tries to allow the student to test any mechanism
%   at the worst case. In this sense, q should be adjusted 
%   as the pose where each joint would (statically) be needing a
%   higher torque.
%   The maximum_speeds and maximum_acceleration define a trapezoidal
%   speed profile. This trapezoidal speed is used by most machines
%   to command changes in speed in any of their joints.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% robot pose: experiment by changing the pose while observing the different
%             torques at each joint
q=[0 0]; %rad
%maximum speeds at for each joint
maximum_speeds=[pi pi];%rad/second
%maximum acceleration/deceleration for each joint
maximum_accels=[pi/4 pi/4]; %rad/second^2

% time of the trapezoidal profile that the joint moves at maximum speed
time_at_constant_speed=3; %seconds

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% FINALLY, COMPUTE TORQUES FOR EACH MOTION STATE. 
% Please note that we consider that the robot is placed at a fixed position and consider
% different motion situations when we change the acceleration and speed at
% each joint. For each motion state, the inverse dynamic model returns the
% torques at each joint that would bring the robot to that motion.
