% Solve the following exercises:
%   A) Exercise A: Use the Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm to integrate the
%   differential equation:
%            dy/dt = 2*t
%      Integrate from t0=0, to tfinal = 10 s.
%      Compare the solution with the algebraic integration.
%   B) Exercise B: Use the Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm to integrate the
%   second order differential equation:
%            d2y/dt^2+5*dy/dt + 4*y(t) = 0
%
%   C) Exercise C: Use the Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm to simulate the movement
%   of a 1 dof robot arm with friction under the effect of gravity and with
%   zero torque applied.
%
%   D) Exercise D: Use the Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm to simulate the movement
%   of a 2 dof robot arm with friction under the effect of gravity and with
%   zero torques applied.
