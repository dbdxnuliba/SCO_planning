%   DRAW_PATCH(F, V, C, transparent)
%
%   Draws a link using faces F and vertices V.
%   C Defines the color of the robot.
%   If transparent == 1, the robot is drawn with transparency.
%   
%   Example of use. Move to the directory arte/robots/ABB/IRB140, for example:
%   >> [f, v, c] = stl_read('link0.stl')
%   >> draw_patch(f, v)
%
