%   INVERSE KINEMATICS FOR THE SAWYER ROBOT
%
%   Solves the inverse kinematic problem in various situations.
%   A Jacobian based method is used.
%   The method tries to reach the given position/orientation while, at the 
%   same time, maximizing/minimizing a secondary target.
%
%   e.g. reach position/orientation and maximize manipulability det(J'J)
