%   Inverse dynamics for the 2dof planar robot
%
%   tau = inversedynamics_2dofplanar(robot, q, qd, qdd, gc, fext)
%   
%   Where robot stores the kinematic and dynamic parameters for this robot.
%   q: joint positions.
%   qd: joint velocities.
%   qdd: joint accelerations.
%   fext: vector of external forces. Defined in the BASE reference system.
%
%   This function just executes the inverse dynamic model for this robot.
%   The equations to compute this dynamic model can be found in:
%   "ROBOT ANALYSIS. The mechanics of Serial and Parallel
%        manipulators". Lung Weng Tsai. John Wiley and Sons, inc. ISBN:
%        0-471-32593-7. page 405.
